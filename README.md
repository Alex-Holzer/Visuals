# Visual Repository

Welcome to the Visual Repository! This repository contains a collection of various visualizations created using Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries in Python. Visualizations are a powerful way to represent and understand data, and this repository showcases a range of different plots.

## Contents

The repository includes the following types of plots created using corresponding functions from the three libraries:

- Bar Chart
- Stacked Bar Chart
- Histogram
- Box Plot
- Line Chart
- Scatter Plot
- Bubble Plot
- Heat Map

## Plots

Here's a brief description of each type of plot and how to find them in the repository:

- **Bar Chart**: A bar chart is a common way to visualize categorical data with rectangular bars. Check out the `bar_chart` folder for examples.

- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Stacked bar charts are used to show the total and partial contribution of individual categories. Find examples in the `stacked_bar_chart` folder.

- **Histogram**: Histograms display the distribution of numerical data. Look in the `histogram` folder for different examples.

- **Box Plot**: Box plots, also known as whisker plots, provide insights into the distribution of data including median, quartiles, and potential outliers. Explore the `box_plot` folder.

- **Line Chart**: Line charts are great for visualizing trends over time. Navigate to the `line_chart` folder for examples.

- **Scatter Plot**: Scatter plots show the relationship between two numerical variables. Discover various scatter plots in the `scatter_plot` folder.

- **Bubble Plot**: Bubble plots are an extension of scatter plots where the size of the markers represents a third dimension. Check out the `bubble_plot` folder.

- **Heat Map**: Heat maps are used to visualize data in a matrix form with color-coding to represent values. Find examples in the `heat_map` folder.

## Usage

Each plot type has its own dedicated folder containing example code and visuals created using the Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. You can explore the code to understand how each plot is created and customized.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more example plots, improving existing ones, or adding more documentation. Fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Happy plotting!
